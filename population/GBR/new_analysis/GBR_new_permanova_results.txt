NEW PERMANOVA ANALYSIS for Population: GBR 

1. Effect of Method only:
Permutation test for adonis under reduced model
Permutation: free
Number of permutations: 999

adonis2(formula = pc_matrix ~ Method, data = permanova_data, permutations = 999, method = "euclidean")
          Df SumOfSqs R2     F Pr(>F)
Model      1    0.000  0 5e-04      1
Residual 180   10.005  1             
Total    181   10.005  1             

Note: Only one SuperPop level found, so SuperPop PERMANOVA tests were skipped.
