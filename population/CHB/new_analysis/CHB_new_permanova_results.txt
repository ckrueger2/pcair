NEW PERMANOVA ANALYSIS for Population: CHB 

1. Effect of Method only:
Permutation test for adonis under reduced model
Permutation: free
Number of permutations: 999

adonis2(formula = pc_matrix ~ Method, data = permanova_data, permutations = 999, method = "euclidean")
          Df SumOfSqs R2  F Pr(>F)
Model      1        0  0  0      1
Residual 204       10  1          
Total    205       10  1          

Note: Only one SuperPop level found, so SuperPop PERMANOVA tests were skipped.
