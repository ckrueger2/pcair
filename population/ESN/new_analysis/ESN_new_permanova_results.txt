NEW PERMANOVA ANALYSIS for Population: ESN 

1. Effect of Method only:
Permutation test for adonis under reduced model
Permutation: free
Number of permutations: 999

adonis2(formula = pc_matrix ~ Method, data = permanova_data, permutations = 999, method = "euclidean")

Note: Only one SuperPop level found, so SuperPop PERMANOVA tests were skipped.
